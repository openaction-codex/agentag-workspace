# Specify Linear Issues for Implementation

Turn Linear issues into implementation-ready specifications and save them in
Linear.

## Inputs

Require one or more Linear issue IDs, such as `OPE-123` or
`OPE-123,OPE-456`. Ask only when an issue or repository cannot be resolved
unambiguously.

## Operating rules

- Follow the testing, Git, and CI policy in the workspace root `AGENTS.md`.
  This workflow is read-only for code: do not run tests, commit, or push, and
  never prescribe a full local suite in the generated specification.
- Follow the repository's `AGENTS.md` and local contribution instructions.
- Run from the relevant repository checkout and preserve unrelated changes.
  Treat code inspection as read-only: do not edit code or push branches while
  preparing a specification.
- Use the GitHub and Linear access available in the local environment. Require
  enough access to read and update every issue and inspect linked context; stop
  and report a missing capability that prevents completion.

## Workflow

1. Read each issue's title, body, status, labels, links, attachments, and all
   comments. Treat later clarifications as authoritative.
2. Move the issue to `Specification in progress`.
3. Resolve the relevant repository from issue context and links. Fetch the
   latest `main` without discarding local work.
4. Inspect the implementation on `origin/main`, including adjacent behavior,
   tests, migrations, configuration, and established conventions.
5. Extract only implementation-relevant facts and decisions that are not
   already clear from the issue: current code paths, ownership boundaries,
   contracts, constraints, risks, edge cases, and focused validation. Ask the
   user only when a decision materially changes the scope or product behavior.
6. Draft one concise English specification per issue with the template below.
   Complement the issue; do not repeat its title, problem statement, requested
   behavior, acceptance criteria, customer context, or discussion. Keep lines
   near 80 characters when practical.
7. Re-read the issue and relevant code to verify every file reference and
   technical claim.
8. Preserve the existing issue body. Replace an existing generated
   specification for that issue; otherwise append the new one in a fenced
   Markdown block. Do not post the specification as a comment.
9. Move the issue to `Spec to review` only after its body update succeeds.
10. Return a concise summary with issue links, repository, important decisions,
    and any unresolved question.

## Specification template

Use the verified `origin/main` commit as the baseline. Keep `Implementation
context`, `Implementation design`, and `Validation`. Include the other sections
only when they add concrete implementation information; do not emit empty
headings or generic boilerplate.

```markdown
# Implementation design

* `<component or layer>`: <intended change and why it fits the existing
  architecture>
* <Describe required data flow, state transitions, contracts, and invariants.
  Name likely files or symbols when verified, without prescribing incidental
  low-level edits.>

# Impacts and constraints

* <Describe affected API/events, persistence, migrations, permissions,
  security/privacy, performance, observability, compatibility, deployment, or
  rollback constraints. Include only relevant items.>

# Edge cases

* <State a concrete boundary, failure mode, concurrency/idempotency case, or
  legacy-data condition and the expected implementation behavior.>

# Validation

* `<individual test file or test case>`: <specific scenario and expected
  assertion to add or update>
* `<focused command>`: <what it validates; include only commands verified for
  this repository>
* <Mention Coolify preview validation only for `citipo/openaction-europe`.
  Other projects must not depend on preview URLs.>

# Scope and open decisions

* Out of scope: <adjacent change that should deliberately remain untouched>
* Decision: <non-obvious technical choice and rationale>
* Open question: <unresolved implementation uncertainty, impact, and who or
  what can resolve it>

# Implementation context

Repository: <owner/repository>

* `<path>` — `<symbol, module, route, schema, or test>`: <verified current
  behavior, dependency, convention, or invariant relevant to this change>
* <Describe the current execution/data flow only as needed to explain the
  implementation design.>
```

Do not repeat the generic branch, formatting, PR, CI, or Linear lifecycle in
the generated specification. The `implement-issue` skill owns that workflow and
uses this specification for issue-specific technical guidance.

## Quality check

Before updating Linear, verify that the specification:

- matches the issue and latest discussion and is grounded in the current
  codebase, with concrete anchors and scenario-level tests;
- names only focused local validation and never prescribes a full test suite;
- adds implementation guidance rather than paraphrasing the issue, separating
  verified behavior, proposed design, and open questions;
- covers relevant contracts, data, security, compatibility, edge cases, and
  scope without boilerplate;
- contains no sensitive or irrelevant details and is actionable without
  prescribing incidental edits or duplicating the generic workflow.
